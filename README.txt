Notes for TA/Grader:
	It wasn't super clear as to how the sum should be generated (ex://either by user input or a random number generator) so I decided to just have the user input the target value. The two sum function/method still works the same way that it should even with the user target input. Everything seems to be working, and it returns the correct values based on the conditions set by the twoSum method. The only thing that I couldn't make a little less redundant were the messages that print every single time the numbers are checked inside of the twoSum method. However, the last message where the loop terminates is always correct. I sorted the array, and the result just in case.
